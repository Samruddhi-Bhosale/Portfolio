Welcome to my portfolio! This project showcases my skills and projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The portfolio features a responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring an optimal viewing experience on both mobile and desktop devices. 
I've incorporated interactive elements using JavaScript, including modals, animations, and form validations, to enhance user engagement.
The code is organized and well-commented for clarity and maintainability.
